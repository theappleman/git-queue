These are my personal patches for git.git.

They are all pretty small changes, so I haven't really sent them off for
inclusion proper.

Also, there are no S-o-b lines, so you can't actually let them get included.
However, I would be happy to add them and send them to be included if someone
thinks that it is useful enough.

If you wish, test and modify them yourself. If you send them for inclusion,
it'll be kind if you send it with your own name and Cc: me or something.
